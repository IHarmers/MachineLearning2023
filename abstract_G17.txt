Abstract (Group 17)

For our semester project, we have chosen the project topic 'Handwritten digit recognition'. 
We aim to compare the model performance of the linear classifier to other classifiers such as k-Nearest Neighbor, RandomForest and CNN.
When applying these models, we will consider the effect of different preprocessing methods on the data, e.g. 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering.
